# Summary
This repository contains data (except raw sequencing data), jupyter notebooks and other source code used in our recent project on microbial release rates. In this project we test the hypothesis that microbial release rates are negatively correlated with metabolites' inherent value. We also ask how important this factor is compared to other factors in explaining metabolite release rates and how microbial release rates change over a 4-6 week long evolution experiment with _E. coli_ kockout mutants.

# Repository folder structure
