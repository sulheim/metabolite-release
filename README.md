# Summary
This repository contains data (except raw sequencing data), jupyter notebooks and other source code used in our recent project on microbial release rates. In this project we test the hypothesis that microbial release rates are negatively correlated with metabolites' inherent value. We also ask how important this factor is compared to other factors in explaining metabolite release rates and how microbial release rates change over a 4-6 week long evolution experiment with _E. coli_ kockout mutants.

# Repository folder structure
Detailed description of folder content is given in the README located in each folder. 

## Data
This folder contains all data (except sequencing data) used for the analyses and plots presented in the associated paper, including experimental data generated in this project and data collected from other sources. The raw sequencing data is available in the [NCBI SRA database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under the BioProject ID PRJNA1270783.

## Notebooks
All jupyter notebooks used for the analyses and plots presented in the associated paper.

## Code
Matlab and python code used to parse and analyse data.

## Models
This folder contains the original and modified genome-scale metabolic models used in this project. This include the following species:
- _B. licheniformis_
- _C. glutamicum_
- _E. coli_
- _P. putida_
- _S. cerevisiae_
